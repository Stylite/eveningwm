# EveningWm

Less features, less problems
![](scrot.png)

### What is EveningWm and why would I ever use it?
EveningWm is a super minimal floating X window manager built using Xlib. It is only 67 SLOC (generated by sloccount) and it features no configuration file.
With more features, comes more bugs and that's what EveningWm is trying to solve. In the best case scenario, you'll forget that your running a wm at all ;)


This project is a proud fork of the most smallest wm, [TinyWm](http://incise.org/tinywm.html)
(originally written by Nick Welch <nick@incise.org> in 2005 & 2011.)

### Features
* Sloppy focus follows the mouse, to properly focus a window press Alt + Mouse1 on it.
* Move a window with Alt + Mouse1
* Resize a window with Alt + Mouse3
* Raise a window with Alt + r
* Lower a window with Alt + d
* Launch a terminal with Alt + Return (default terminal is urxvt)
* Close EveningWm with Alt + 0

### Configuration
EveningWm is configured by editing the "massive" source code.

### Build requirements
* gcc
* make
* Xlib headers

### Installation
To install EveningWm run:
```
make all
```

and to uninstall:
```
make clean
```

### Things still to be done/known bugs (send help)
* Currently EveningWm doesn't know how to ignore bars, docks etc..
* If any modifier key in addition to Alt (e.g caps lock, num lock..) is pressed the keybinds won't work.
* ~~For some reason firefox context menus stopped working even thought I'm 100% sure they worked just a couple of days ago :(~~

### Gotta give credit where credit is due
* Nick Welch for creating TinyWm.
* [torvim](https://github.com/torvim) (browsing neutrawm's source code helped a ton.)
* The whole r/unixporn community for motivation.

### Warning
EveningWm is my first actual C project ever, so expect the worst but hope for the best.
